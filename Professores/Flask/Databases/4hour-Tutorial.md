# *4-hour SQL tutorial with breaks for analysis and examples to guide you through learning SQL.*

## 1. Introduction to SQL (30 minutes)

### What is SQL?
- **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage (SQL) is a domain-specific language used in programming and managing relational databases.

### Basic SQL Statements:
- **SELECT**: Retrieve data from a database.
- **INSERT**: Insert new records into a table.
- **UPDATE**: Update existing records in a table.
- **DELETE**: Delete records from a table.

### Example:
```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE Students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO Students (id, name, age)
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 25), (2, 'Bob', 28);

-- Retrieve data
SELECT * FROM Students;
```

## Break (10 minutes) - Analyze the example and try creating your table and inserting data.

---

## 2. Retrieving Data with SELECT (30 minutes)

### SELECT Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Examples:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Students;

SELECT name, age FROM Students WHERE age > 25;
```

## Break (10 minutes) - Practice SELECT queries on your database.

---

## 3. Modifying Data (30 minutes)

### INSERT Syntax:
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

### UPDATE Syntax:
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```

### DELETE Syntax:
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### Examples:
```sql
INSERT INTO Students (id, name, age) VALUES (3, 'Charlie', 22);

UPDATE Students SET age = 30 WHERE name = 'Alice';

DELETE FROM Students WHERE age < 23;
```

## Break (10 minutes) - Experiment with inserting, updating, and deleting data.

---

## 4. Joins and Relationships (30 minutes)

### Understanding Joins:
- **INNER JOIN**: Combines records that have matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.
- **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all records when there is a match in either the left (table1) or the right (table2) table records.

### Examples:
```sql
SELECT Students.name, Courses.course_name
FROM Students
INNER JOIN Courses
ON Students.id = Courses.student_id;

SELECT Students.name, Courses.course_name
FROM Students
LEFT JOIN Courses
ON Students.id = Courses.student_id;
```

## Break (10 minutes) - Practice writing JOIN queries.

---

## 5. Grouping and Aggregations (30 minutes)

### GROUP BY Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, COUNT(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
```

### Aggregation Functions:
- **COUNT()**: Count the number of rows.
- **SUM()**: Calculate the sum of values.
- **AVG()**: Calculate the average of values.
- **MAX()**: Get the maximum value.
- **MIN()**: Get the minimum value.

### Example:
```sql
SELECT country, COUNT(*), AVG(age) as avg_age
FROM Students
GROUP BY country;
```

## Break (10 minutes) - Write queries using GROUP BY and aggregation functions.

---

## 6. Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (30 minutes)

### Subqueries Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1
FROM table1
WHERE column2 IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2);
```

### Common Table Expressions (CTEs):
```sql
WITH cte_name AS (
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
)
SELECT *
FROM cte_name;
```

### Examples:
```sql
SELECT name
FROM Students
WHERE age > (SELECT AVG(age) FROM Students);

WITH SeniorStudents AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM Students
    WHERE age > 25
)
SELECT * FROM SeniorStudents;
```

## Break (10 minutes) - Work on subqueries and CTEs.

---

## 7. Indexing and Optimization (30 minutes)

### Understanding Indexes:
- **CREATE INDEX**: Create an index on a column for faster retrieval.
- **DROP INDEX**: Remove an index.

### Example:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON Students (name);

SELECT * FROM Students WHERE name = 'Alice';
```

## Break (10 minutes) - Experiment with creating and using indexes.

---

## 8. Conclusion and Q&A (30 minutes)

### Recap of Key Concepts:
- SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- Joins and Relationships
- GROUP BY and Aggregations
- Subqueries and CTEs
- Indexing and Optimization
