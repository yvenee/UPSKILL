        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Yvenee and I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself.</p>
            
        <p>I'm Brazilian, but I've been living in Portugal since 2019 with my husband and my dog. I hold a Master's degree in Management and a bachelor's degree in Accounting. In 2020, I decided to take on a new challenge and entered the IT field, obtaining a Technology Certification in Information Systems Technologies and Programming. This marked my first contact with the IT industry, and I gained knowledge in programming languages such as C, C#, Java, JavaScript, SQL Server, and .NET. In April 2022, I began an internship where I primarily used Python as the main programming language, and I'm very excited about it. I'm focused on building my career in Development and actively seeking new opportunities in the IT field.</p>
        
        <p>Currently, I'm studying at the Python Academy at Instituto Politécnico de Viseu - Escola de Tecnologia e Gestão.</p>
