        "This code is written in python, running Django framework, specifically focusing on url configuration where it doesn't even include any logic, functions, or classes. It's primarily navigating the urls and routes to where they need to go.\n\nHere's the code breakdown:\n\n\n\n**Explanation**\n\n1. It begins with importing the necessary Django modules, 'admin' for admin site, 'include' and 'path' for urls, 'staticfiles_urlpatterns' for handling static files.\n\n2. `urlpatterns` is a list that Django checks when it receives a request. Each path in this list is defined by the `path` function. Each path is associated with a certain view(i.e., what the user sees).\n\n3. The `path('admin/', admin.site.urls),` is used for Django's in-built administrative functions. `admin.site.urls` is a built-in Django module, including a lot of useful URLs for handling administrative activities.\n\n4. `path(\"\", include(\"hello.urls\"))`, means Django will now direct anything that comes into 'http://localhost/' to `hello.urls` for further instructions. It allows delegation of parts of the route to another file, which makes it easier for organizing.\n\n5. `urlpatterns += staticfiles_urlpatterns()` This line is adding the URLS patterns for static files to the `urlpatterns`. It's Django's way to handle static files which are not bound to models or views, such as CSS or JavaScript files.\n\n**Result**\n\nThis script does not print any output because it primarily functions to guide the Django application routing system to the right views using URLs. Its success or failure can be determined by whether it correctly routes URLs to the correct location during the runtime of the Django application."
